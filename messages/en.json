      "p3": "Throughout my multiple projects, I learned how to integrate complex functionality while ensuring a seamless user experience. More importantly, I realized the power of self-learning and how crucial it is for my growth as a developer, especially when faced with challenges in full-stack and AI development.",
      "p4": "I've made many mistakes on this journey, and I'll make many more. What I've learned is that mistakes are nothing to be afraid of. What I should be afraid of is not trying at all, because if I don't try, I'll miss out on what I truly enjoy."
